<ul>
<li><strong>Containerization:</strong> Standardized units (TEU), cranes (STS), yard systems, intermodal integration.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Bulk & Liquid Systems:</strong> High-capacity unloaders, conveyor systems, pipelines, storage tanks, safety engineering.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Both container and non-container terminals modernized during the same era, but followed different engineering logics. Containerization focuses on standardization and unit handling, while bulk systems focus on high-volume mechanized flow.
</p>
<p>
<h3>1. Why Ports Matter</h3>
<p>
Ports are critical nodes in global and national supply chains, enabling the movement of goods, energy, and raw materials. 
Approximately 80–90% of world trade by volume is transported by sea, making port infrastructure a strategic economic asset.
For an archipelagic country such as Indonesia, ports are not only international gateways but also essential connectors 
between islands, production centers, and consumption markets.
</p>

<h3>2. Engineering Perspective</h3>
<p>
Port engineering is an interdisciplinary field integrating coastal hydrodynamics, 
geotechnical engineering, structural design, and terminal operations. 
The design of a port must consider wave transformation, tidal range, storm surge levels, 
sediment transport mechanisms, and long-term morphological evolution.
</p>

<p>
From a structural standpoint, quay walls, breakwaters, and berthing structures must 
withstand lateral earth pressures, mooring loads, ship impact forces, and cyclic 
environmental loading. Geotechnical investigation is critical to assess bearing capacity, 
settlement, liquefaction potential, and soil–structure interaction.
</p>

<p>
Operational efficiency is equally important. Engineers must evaluate berth occupancy ratio (BOR), 
turnaround time, cargo handling rate (tons/hour or moves/hour), storage capacity, 
and hinterland connectivity. Sustainable design requires balancing technical feasibility, 
economic viability, environmental protection, and long-term maintenance strategy.
</p>

<h3>3. Terminal Types and Handling Logic</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bulk Terminal:</strong> Berth → Conveyor → Stockyard</li>
<li><strong>Container Terminal:</strong> Berth (STS) → Yard (RTG/RMG) → Gate</li>
<li><strong>Liquid Bulk Terminal:</strong> Berth (Loading Arm) → Pipeline → Storage Tanks</li>
<li><strong>Car (Ro-Ro) Terminal:</strong> Ramp Berth → Parking Yard → Gate</li>
</ul>

</table>
<p>
Each terminal type has different engineering constraints, operational performance indicators, 
and infrastructure requirements. 
Port engineering must therefore adopt a cargo-specific design and operational approach.
</p>
<p>
Multipurpose terminals are common in developing and archipelagic economies such as Indonesia. 
Rather than specializing in a single cargo type, these terminals are designed for operational flexibility, 
allowing them to handle dry bulk, general cargo, project cargo, and occasionally containers within the same berth area. 
While this flexibility improves asset utilization and market adaptability, it typically results in lower peak productivity 
compared to highly specialized terminals.
</p>
<h3>4. Indonesian Context</h3>
<p>
Indonesia’s non-container cargo throughput is estimated at approximately 1.7 billion tons per year. 
Of this volume, around 110 million tons are handled through terminals managed by SPMT, 
indicating an estimated market share of roughly 6–7%. 
This highlights both the competitive structure of the sector and the potential for strategic growth.
</p>

<h3>5. Course Roadmap</h3>
<p>
This course is structured in three progressive stages:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Marine environment and physical port infrastructure (waves, tides, breakwaters, quay structures)</li>
<li>Terminal engineering for dry bulk, liquid bulk, container, and vehicle handling systems</li>
<li>Port performance, competitiveness, and strategic infrastructure management</li>
</ol>

<h4>Engineering Mindset in Port Development</h4>

<p>
Port engineering requires systems thinking. Decisions on dredging depth, quay wall design, or yard layout directly affect operational efficiency, safety, and long-term competitiveness. Engineers must integrate physical coastal processes with logistics performance and economic feasibility.
</p>

<p>
A well-designed port is not only structurally stable, but also operationally efficient and strategically adaptable.
</p>
<p>
By the end of the semester, students should be able to connect coastal processes, terminal design, 
and operational strategy into a coherent port engineering framework.
