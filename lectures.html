<h2>Port Engineering – Lecture Modules</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Lecture 1 – Introduction to Port Engineering</h3>
<p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the economic role of ports in national and global trade</li>
<li>Identify major types of ports and their functions</li>
<li>Recognize key infrastructure components</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Topics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Historical development of ports</li>
<li>Classification of ports</li>
<li>Basic terminology</li>
<li>Overview of Indonesian port system</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lecture Overview:</strong></p>
<p>
Ports are critical nodes in global and national supply chains, enabling the movement of goods,
energy, and raw materials. Approximately 80–90% of world trade by volume is transported by sea,
making port infrastructure a strategic economic asset. For an archipelagic country such as Indonesia,
ports are not only international gateways but also essential connectors between islands,
production centers, and consumption markets.
</p>

<p>
From an engineering perspective, port design requires integration of coastal processes,
geotechnical stability, structural performance, and operational efficiency. Engineers must evaluate
wave climate, tidal dynamics, sediment transport, navigation safety, berthing loads, and long-term
maintenance requirements. Technical design decisions must also consider economic feasibility,
logistics performance, and environmental sustainability.
</p>

<p>
This lecture introduces fundamental terminology such as breakwater, quay wall, berth,
draft, turning basin, and terminal layout. Students will explore how physical infrastructure,
marine conditions, and hinterland connectivity interact to determine port performance.
</p>

<p>
Special attention is given to Indonesian case studies, including Belawan and other
major ports, to understand real-world challenges such as sedimentation,
capacity expansion, land subsidence, and climate-related risks.
