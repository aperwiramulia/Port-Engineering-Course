<h2>Port Engineering – Lecture Modules</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Lecture 1 – Introduction to Port Engineering</h3>
<p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the economic role of ports in national and global trade</li>
<li>Identify major types of ports and their functions</li>
<li>Recognize key infrastructure components</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Topics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Historical development of ports</li>
<li>Classification of ports</li>
<li>Basic terminology</li>
<li>Overview of Indonesian port system</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lecture Overview:</strong></p>
<p>
<h3>1. Why Ports Matter</h3>
<p>
Ports are critical nodes in global and national supply chains, enabling the movement of goods, energy, and raw materials. 
Approximately 80–90% of world trade by volume is transported by sea, making port infrastructure a strategic economic asset.
For an archipelagic country such as Indonesia, ports are not only international gateways but also essential connectors 
between islands, production centers, and consumption markets.
</p>

<h3>2. Engineering Perspective</h3>
<p>
Port engineering is an interdisciplinary field integrating coastal hydrodynamics, 
geotechnical engineering, structural design, and terminal operations. 
The design of a port must consider wave transformation, tidal range, storm surge levels, 
sediment transport mechanisms, and long-term morphological evolution.
</p>

<p>
From a structural standpoint, quay walls, breakwaters, and berthing structures must 
withstand lateral earth pressures, mooring loads, ship impact forces, and cyclic 
environmental loading. Geotechnical investigation is critical to assess bearing capacity, 
settlement, liquefaction potential, and soil–structure interaction.
</p>

<p>
Operational efficiency is equally important. Engineers must evaluate berth occupancy ratio (BOR), 
turnaround time, cargo handling rate (tons/hour or moves/hour), storage capacity, 
and hinterland connectivity. Sustainable design requires balancing technical feasibility, 
economic viability, environmental protection, and long-term maintenance strategy.
</p>

<h3>3. Terminal Types and Handling Logic</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bulk Terminal:</strong> Berth → Conveyor → Stockyard</li>
<li><strong>Container Terminal:</strong> Berth (STS) → Yard (RTG/RMG) → Gate</li>
<li><strong>Liquid Bulk Terminal:</strong> Berth (Loading Arm) → Pipeline → Storage Tanks</li>
<li><strong>Car (Ro-Ro) Terminal:</strong> Ramp Berth → Parking Yard → Gate</li>
</ul>
<h3>Terminal Comparison Overview</h3>

<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<th>Terminal Type</th>
<th>Main Flow Logic</th>
<th>Primary Unit</th>
<th>Key Engineering Constraints</th>
<th>Main Performance Indicator</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Dry Bulk</td>
<td>Berth → Conveyor → Stockyard</td>
<td>Tons</td>
<td>Draft depth, sedimentation, dust control</td>
<td>Tons/hour, Berth Occupancy Ratio</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Container</td>
<td>Berth → Yard → Gate</td>
<td>TEU</td>
<td>Yard congestion, crane productivity</td>
<td>Moves/hour, Dwell Time</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Liquid Bulk</td>
<td>Berth → Pipeline → Storage Tanks</td>
<td>Tons or m³</td>
<td>Safety, leakage control, fire protection</td>
<td>Pumping rate, Tank utilization</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Car (Ro-Ro)</td>
<td>Ramp → Parking Yard → Gate</td>
<td>Units (vehicles)</td>
<td>Space planning, traffic flow</td>
<td>Units/day, Yard turnover</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Each terminal type has different engineering constraints, operational performance indicators, 
and infrastructure requirements. Port engineering must therefore be cargo-specific.
</p>

<h3>4. Indonesian Context</h3>
<p>
Indonesia’s non-container cargo throughput is estimated at approximately 1.7 billion tons per year. 
Of this volume, around 110 million tons are handled through terminals managed by SPMT, 
indicating an estimated market share of roughly 6–7%. 
This highlights both the competitive structure of the sector and the potential for strategic growth.
</p>

<h3>5. Course Roadmap</h3>
<p>
This course is structured in three progressive stages:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Marine environment and physical port infrastructure (waves, tides, breakwaters, quay structures)</li>
<li>Terminal engineering for dry bulk, liquid bulk, container, and vehicle handling systems</li>
<li>Port performance, competitiveness, and strategic infrastructure management</li>
</ol>

<p>
By the end of the semester, students should be able to connect coastal processes, terminal design, 
and operational strategy into a coherent port engineering framework.
